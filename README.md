# 1-Build
## Linux

## Windows
### Using Linux subsystem under Windows 10 64-bit
_notes: Script and instructions contributed by 3d-gussner. Use at your own risk. Script downloads Arduino executables outside of Prusa control. Report problems [there.](https://github.com/3d-gussner/Arduino_Boards/issues)._
- follow the Microsoft guide https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
- Tested versions are at this moment
  - Ubuntu other may different
  - After the installation and reboot please open your Ubuntu bash and do following steps
  - run command `apt-get update`
  - run command `apt-get upgrade` to update your OS.

#### Some Tips for Ubuntu
- Linux is case sensetive so please don't forget to use capital letters where needed, like changing to a directory
- To change the path to your Prusa-Firmware location you downloaded and unzipped
  - Example: You files are under `C:\Users\<your-username>\Downloads\Arduino_Boards`
  - use under Ubuntu the following command `cd /mnt/c/Users/<your-username>/Downloads/Arduino_Boards`
    to change to the right folder
- Unix and windows have different line endings (LF vs CRLF), try dos2unix to convert
  - This should fix the `"$'\r': command not found"` error
  - to install run `apt-get install dos2unix`

#### Modify Arduino_Boards with Ubuntu Linux subsystem installed
- open Ubuntu bash
- change to your source code folder (case sensitive)
- Read How-to-modify below
- run `./Prepare-new-version.sh`
- Read How-to-modify part `package_prusa3d_index.json` below

### Using Git-bash under Windows 10 64-bit
_notes: Script and instructions contributed by 3d-gussner. Use at your own risk. Script downloads Arduino executables outside of Prusa control. Report problems [there.](https://github.com/3d-gussner/Prusa-Firmware/issues) Multi language build is supported._
- Download and install the 64bit Git version https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Also follow these instructions https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058

#### Compile Prusa-firmware with Git-bash installed
- open Git-bash
- Read How-to-modify below
- change to your source code folder
- run `bash Prepare-new-version.sh`
- Read How-to-modify `package_prusa3d_index.json` below

# 2-How-to-modify
Folder Structure:
-IDE_Boards_Manager
 |-prusa3dboards          Please don't change that folder name when you update your Github and post a PR.
   |-bootloaders
     |-prusa_einsy_rambo  Which is a clone of https://github.com/prusa3d/stk500v2-prusa 
     |-prusa_mm_control
   |-cores
     |-prusa_einsy_rambo
   |-variants
     |-prusa_einsy_rambo
     |-prusa_mm_control

Files:
- `/IDE_Boards_Manager/boards.txt` contains definitions for the boards (board name, parameters for building and uploading sketches, etc.). More information (here)[https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.5-3rd-party-Hardware-specification#boardstxt]
- `/IDE_Boards_Manager/platform.txt`contains definitions for the CPU architecture used (compiler, build process parameters, tools used for upload, etc.). More infotmation (here)[https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.5-3rd-party-Hardware-specification#platformtxt]
- `/IDE_Boards_Manager/package_prusa3d_index.json` More inforation (here)[https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.6.x-package_index.json-format-specification]
- `/IDE_Boards_Manager/prusa3dboards.version` contains the release version numbers and is used in `Prepare-new-version.sh`. The first line is used.

Naming convention for version:
<`major:#1`.`minor:#2`.`maintenance:#2`"-`devel status:0-4`-`devel build:#6`" where `-devel status` and `devel build` are optional
`#1` = numbers 0-9
`#2` = numbers 0-99
`0-4`= only numbers between 0 and 4. 0=devel, 1=alpha, 2=beta, 3=pre-release, 4=release candidate
`#4` = numbers 0-999999

Few examples:

1.0.0-0-235 Is a version in development and devel build 235.
1.0.0       Is the frist stable version
1.0.1       Is a stable version that was maintaind...like adding a bootloader or changing tools to existing boards
1.1.0-3     Is a pre-release version including new boards
1.1.0       Is the first stable version including new boards
